This work develops a robust statistical framework for parameter estimation of stochastic signals. This framework is based on the hyperbolic distribution [[2305.04709](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.04709)]. The hyperbolic likelihood can be used to perform parameter estimation of the signal, and at the same time detect any departures from Gaussianities. 

In order to demonstrate the capabilities of such framework, we have generated synthetic data of the future [LISA mission](https://www.esa.int/Science_Exploration/Space_Science/LISA_factsheet). The data contain Gravitational Wave signals emmitted by the $$\mathcal{O}(10^7)$$ Double White Dwarf binaries in our Galaxy. 

You can download the data (in `h5` format) using [this link](http://data.physics.auth.gr/heavier_tailed_likelihood/ucb_signal_lisa.h5).

The data contain the signal in the noise-orthogonal Time Delay Interferometer channels A and E. It also contains the
